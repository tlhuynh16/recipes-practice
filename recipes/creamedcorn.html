        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Creamed corn is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: sweet corn mixed with a creamy sauce. It is often served as a side dish at barbecues or holidays, like Thanksgiving.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen corn kernels, thawed</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine corn, heavy cream, sugar, butter, salt, and pepper in a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until butter has melted, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, whisk together milk and flour in a small bowl until smooth.</li>
                <li>Add milk mixture to the skillet and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and corn is cooked through, about 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat, and stir in Parmesan cheese until melted. Serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
